Branches
========

Tooling
-------

The main tooling branches go here. The distinction is not sharp, but that's fine.

+ __master__ : This is the main production line. Use for general tools, not for project specific
   code. 

+ __gslport__ : Porting GSL to D

+ __specd_branch__ : This is a subtree branch for specd, a specifications tool for D, used in unittests. 
  I use this for making improvements to the tests etc.


Science
-------

+ __cosmo__ : General cosmology code

+ __qpm__ : Code to compute the effect of reconstruction on the QuickPM mock catalogs

+ __vptree__ : Vantage point tree code, to build a projected correlation function code for Duncan Campbell.
