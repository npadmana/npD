GSL bindings to D go here.

These stick (as closely as I could) to the GSL API. These files are publically imported by the routines
in the directory above, which (where I felt like it) provide convenience wrappers around these routines.

common : Some common routines, plus some low-level convenience functions

histogram, histogram2d : GSL histogramming routines (the fread/fwrite routines have not been ported).
integration : GSL integration routines
interpolation : GSL interpolation and spline routines
qrng : Quasi-random numbers
