- Define the initial bounding box (theta, phi, r)
- Loop over n 6D points from the qrng
	- Choose a point in 3D space based on bounding box
	- Test if point is in mask
	- Choose a point in the radial shell 
	- rotate the point to the first point
	- test if second point is in mask
		- remap r1 and r2 to z1 and z2, work out r1t and r2t
		- work out true and apparent separation
		- Add to mu bins
- Normalize by number of points and Jacobian
- Compute monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole.
