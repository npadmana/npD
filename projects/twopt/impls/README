Two-point correlation function implementations
==============================================

Unfortunately, a simple one-size-fits-all 2-point correlation function code is 
tricky. Different applications have slightly different needs, mostly around
how best to sequence files in and out of the code, whether one needs RR and DR terms
etc. 

One approach is to have all applications use exactly the same code, but then write 
shims that produce the input in the correct format. This gets very clumsy very 
quickly.

This directory keeps different implementations of the wrappers around the
correlation function codes. These are mostly all built off the do_smu, do_ppp_smu and
do_pll codes. This file will keep track of the various implementations; hopefully
most cases will find a close enough match here. 


Implementations
===============


do2pt_ppp_smu_sqlite 
--------------------
  -- Periodic, plane-parallel
  -- Computes s-mu
  -- SQLite 
  	-- The input catalogs are assumed to be in an SQLite database file
  	-- The various samples are specified as SQL queries
  	-- The input configurations and the outputs are stored in another
  	   sqlite database, which is passed in to the code.
